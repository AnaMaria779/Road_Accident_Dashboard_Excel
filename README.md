# Road Accidents Casualties Analysis  
This project presents an in-depth analysis of road accident casualties based on the provided dataset. The objective is to uncover insights into accident severity, casualty distribution, and patterns based on different factors such as vehicle type, road type, location, and time.

## Project Overview  
The analysis was conducted using *Microsoft Excel*, leveraging data visualization tools, pivot tables, and formulas to extract key performance indicators (KPIs) and identify casualty trends.

## Dataset  
The dataset contains information on road accidents, including accident severity, vehicle type, road surface conditions, time of the accident, and casualties.

## Key Insights  
### Primary KPIs  
- *Total Casualties Taken Place After the Accident*  
  ✅ Displayed the *total number of casualties* across all accidents.  

- *Total Casualties and Percentages by Accident Severity*  
  ✅ Calculated casualties by *Accident Severity* (Fatal, Serious, Slight) and their *percentage contribution* to the total casualties using pivot tables.

- *Maximum Casualties by Type of Vehicle*  
  ✅ Identified the *vehicle type with the highest number of casualties*.

### Secondary KPIs  
- *Total Casualties by Vehicle Type*  
  ✅ Created a table showing the *total casualties per vehicle type*.

### Trend Analysis  
- *Monthly Trend of Casualties (Current vs. Previous Year)*  
  ✅ Visualized the *monthly trend* of casualties with a line chart to compare the *current year vs. previous year*.
### Road & Location Analysis  
- *Maximum Casualties by Road Type*  
  ✅ Identified the *road type with the highest number of casualties*.  

- *Distribution of Total Casualties by Road Surface Condition*  
  ✅ Created a bar chart to visualize casualties across different *road surface conditions* (Dry, Wet, Snow, etc.).

- *Casualties by Area/Location and Day/Night Relation*  
  ✅ Analyzed the *relation between casualties by area (Urban/Rural)* and whether the accident happened during the *Day or Night*.

## Tools Used  
- Microsoft Excel  
- Pivot Tables  
- Charts & Graphs  
- Conditional Formatting  

## How to Use This Project  
1. Download the Excel file from https://1drv.ms/x/c/fe60740175cb5cb8/EYjStP7R4YJKjz4g7gvxh8oBzVh3Q41a_C3ynJvWGYp-lw?e=NJOGmF  
2. Open the file with *Microsoft Excel*.  
3. Explore the different sheets to view the KPIs and visualizations.  
4. Use filters or pivot table slicers (if available) to customize the view.  

## Future Improvements  
- Automate report generation with *VBA Macros*.  
- Add interactive slicers for dynamic filtering.  
- Migrate the project to *Power BI* or *Google Looker Studio* for more advanced visualizations.  
- Perform predictive analysis with *Python* or *Excel Forecasting Tools*.  

## Conclusion  
This analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the casualties resulting from road accidents by exploring different factors and identifying trends. These insights can help authorities and stakeholders implement better safety measures to reduce road accident casualties.
